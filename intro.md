# Welcome to Comp-brain

<font color=deeppink>Compbrain</font> is a tool for simulating brain circuits using multiple neurons and synapses mathematical models. The user connects neurons and synapses to form the entire brain circuit and then performs the simulation

It shows off a few of the major neuron models, as well as some synapse models. Check out [the Github repository](https://github.com/boyuan99/comp-brain) for more information.

Check out the content pages bundled with this jupyter book to see more.
